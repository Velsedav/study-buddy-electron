Be brutally honest. This is your personal diagnostic report.\n\nStep 3: If you can't fix the mistakes, go back to the course. Only now do you re-read the relevant course material—but with surgical precision. You know exactly which parts you need to understand better because your error notebook told you.\n\nStep 4: Repeat. After reviewing the course material, go back to Step 1 with NEW exercises. The loop continues until you can test yourself without errors.\n\nThis loop is powerful because it flips the traditional study approach on its head.
